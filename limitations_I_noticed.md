## Agents get stuck in conversations
Players are queried in order for message actions. This can lead to weird ongoing conversations such as 5 rounds of all players agreeing that they should go somewhere before actually going somewhere.

## Overly agreeable joyful and formal language
With gpt models, the conversations rarely feel super natural. It is hard to create conflict between the simulated agents.

## Long simulation times
Simulating a few rounds can definitely take a while.

## You still notice that the agents are the same model at core
For example, gpt4o-mini likes to make it's agents play a round of trivia. It always answers all trivia questions correct with all characters.

## It can be hard to make the agents do what you want
I guess that does make them more agentic somewhat ^^. E.g. I wanted to make the agents argue about a care crash, but they decided to just hang out and play taboo or trivia games instead.
