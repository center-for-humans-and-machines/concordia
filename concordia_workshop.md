## Agent-Based Simulations

---

## Installation instructions
`https://github.com/center-for-humans-and-machines/concordia/installation_instructions.md`

---
### Group work
1. Work through `agent_basic_tutorial` and `agent_components_tutorial` in `examples/tutorial` (5-15 minutes)
2. Check my notebook `examples/lets_get_lunch.ipynb` to get an understanding of how a full system works (No need to execute cells yet).
3. Bootstrap from the notebook to create your own scenarios and play around with components to run your own agent-based simulations.
